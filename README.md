# Gaps of THPS 1

As mentioned in the [Tony Hawk's fandom wiki](https://tonyhawkgames.fandom.com/wiki/Gap) : `A complete gap list for THPS1 was never released`.

So, how can we be sure that all gaps in THPS 1 have been found ?

## Known Gaps

First, I've searched for websites and videos showing where all the gaps were.

At this time, it's [Psychochotics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLarzX6CHWKbTnTMawI2ooS_1Nj0SiUfZg) who is showing more gaps than anyone.

    <summary>Total gaps / Total unique gaps</summary>

    Total gaps : 134
    Total unique gaps : 127
</details>

## Memory

I decided to search inside the THPS 1 game's memory.

To do so, I used `BizHawk` (the same tool I use to TAS), launched the `Hex Editor` and searched for `TRANSFER`.

It brings me this result.

Hm, it seems that it's where all the gaps name are saved (from address _0x0A0604_).

So, the hypothetical full list of gaps is here (the order is kept, not sorted).

Ah, some gaps seem not found yet. Let's take a look.

<details>
    <summary>Gaps not found yet</summary>

## Gaps not found

In the list, we can make some hypotheses :

- Fountain Gap already exists in the list but this one seems to have a typo in its name (the ending square bracket is missing : `[FOUNTAIN GAP` instead of `[FOUNTAIN GAP]`). Hm, this is not a new gap to look for, IMO.
- `125 Feet`, `150 Feet` and `175 Feet` [have already been reached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ui7wSUs2U&t=99s). The others (`200 Feet` / `225 Feet` / `250 Feet`) not yet but are likely to be on the continuity.

But what about the others gaps not found ?

One thing we can notice in the memory is that the gaps are (almost) all grouped by level.

Can we deduce that way in which level those missing gaps are ? Let's try.

### Awning Gap

```
[ROOF 2 ROOF GAP] => School
[SWIM TEAM GAP] => School
[AWNING GAP]
[GARBAGE OLLIE] => School
[ROOF TO AWNING GAP] => School
[DITCH SLAP] => School
[OVER THE AIR CONDITIONER] => School
[OVER A FOOTBRIDGE] => School
[PARK GAP] => School
[MINI GAP] => School
```

`Awning Gap` could be in `School`.

### Ramp Gap

```
[OVER A 16 STAIR SET] => Mall
[OVER A HUGE 32 STAIR GAP] => Mall
[SKATER ESCALATOR GAP] => Mall
[32 STEPS OFF A MEZZANINE] => Mall
[THE FLYING LEAP] => Mall
[RAMP GAP]
[GOING UP GAP] => Mall
[GOING DOWN GAP] => Mall
```

`Ramp Gap` could be in `Mall`.

### Raging Gorge Gap

```
[RAGING GORGE GAP]
[HUGE WATER HAZARD GAP] => Downhill Jam
[50 FEET] => Downhill Jam
[100 FEET] => Downhill Jam
```

`Raging Gorge Gap` could be in `Downhill Jam`.

### Small Water Hazard Gap / Big Water Hazard Gap

```
[50 FEET] => Downhill Jam
[100 FEET] => Downhill Jam
[150 FEET]
[200 FEET]
[250 FEET]
[SMALL WATER HAZARD GAP]
[BIG WATER HAZARD GAP]
[25 FEET] => Downhill Jam
[75 FEET] => Downhill Jam
[125 FEET]
[175 FEET]
[225 FEET]
```

`Small Water Hazard Gap` and `Big Water Hazard Gap` could be in `Downhill Jam`.

### Pagoda Hop

```
[PORCH GAP] => Streets
[LOMBARD GAP] => Streets
[THE GONZ GAP] => Streets
[PAGODA GAP] => Streets
[OVER THE SEVEN] => Streets
[HUBBA GAP] => Streets
[STREET GAP] => Streets
[HANDI GAP] => Streets
[C BLOCK GAP] => Streets
[SPINE GAP] => Streets
[OVERSIZED 8 SET] => Streets
[ACID DROP-IN] => Streets
[FOUNTAIN GAP
[PAGODA HOP]
```

`Pagoda Hop` could be in `Streets`.

### Freakin Pool Grind

```
[CHANNEL GAP] => Warehouse, Roswell
[KICKER 2 LEDGE] => Warehouse
[FREAKIN POOL GRIND]
[ROLL IN CHANNEL GAP] => Roswell
```

`Freakin Pool Grind` could be in `Roswell` (or in `Skate Park` due to other "Pool" gaps).

### Hawk Bridge Grind

```
[TRIPLE RAIL] => Burnside
[BRIDGE GRIND] => Burnside
[HAWK BRIDGE GRIND]
```

`Hawk Bridge Grind` could be in `Burnside`.

### Are You Kidding?

```
[DOWN THE SPIRAL] => Streets
[LOMBARD LEDGE] => Streets
[HUBBA LEDGE] => Streets
[HOOK RAIL] => Streets
[RAIL 2 RAIL] => Streets
[BACKWOODS LEDGE] => Streets
[BENDY'S LIP] => Streets
[ARE YOU KIDDING?]
```

`Are You Kidding?` could be in `Streets`.

## Are there really some missing gaps ?

As seen above, some gaps are questioning.

Are those missing gaps really implemented in the game ?

Another clue to this investigation is when you search exactly for "Small Water Hazard Gap" (here in Google), only one answer is found : [this code repository](https://github.com/Vadru93/THPS2X-Formats).

It seems that this project dumps the gaps existing in THPS 2x. In this game, the levels of THPS 1 are playable but, as mentioned in the [associated wiki](https://tonyhawkgames.fandom.com/wiki/Tony_Hawk's_Pro_Skater_2X), `Gap checklist only includes THPS2 levels`.

Ok, but the fact that some of those missing gaps are present in the codebase of THPS 2x is really intriguing.

### Missing Gaps vs Gaps in THPS 2x

Missing gaps that are in the dump of THPS 2x

- Raging Gorge Gap
- Small Water Hazard Gap
- Pagoda Hop
- Hawk Bridge Grind
- Are You Kidding?

Missing gaps that are _not_ in the dump of THPS 2x

- Awning Gap
- Ramp Gap
- Big Water Hazard Gap
- Freakin Pool Grind

Does this say that those 5 gaps haven't been found yet in THPS 1 ? Arf, can't say, it's just a clue.

## Conclusion

With this little investigation, I cannot conclude that every gaps in THPS 1 have been found yet.

If you have any additional details, you can create [an issue](https://github.com/fullmoonissue/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1/issues/new) ;-D
